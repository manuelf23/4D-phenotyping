# 4D-phenotyping

In this repository you will find the development of three applications. An application for capturing and sensing data from different sensors to perform 4D phenotyping. An application that allows to perform the different calibrations between the sensors and perform the sensory fusion process to obtain 4D information. Finally, another application that allows to visualize the 4D information collected from plants in a 3D distribution.

## Sensing application

This application connects by ssh to the embedded system of the phenotyping platform and is responsible for managing the actuators and sensors of the platform to capture morphological and biochemical information on plants.

## Calibration application

This application allows to calibrate the 4D phenotyping platform and perform the sensory fusion process between the sensors.

## Visualization app

This application allows to visualize the 4D phenotyping result of the sensed plant.
