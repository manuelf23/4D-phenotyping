# 4D-phenotyping
In this repository you will find the development of three applications. An application for capturing and sensing data from different sensors to perform 4D phenotyping. An application that allows to perform the different calibrations between the sensors and perform the sensory fusion process to obtain 4D information. Finally another application that allows to visualize the 4D information collected from plants in a 3D distribution.
